# rr_practice
A *repository* to test out my efforts to make my research more **reproducible**.

## Introduction
Here is some text to ***describe*** the overall goal of my data analysis plan.


## Methods
### Experimental design
We obtained 200 samples from various soils across the state of Michigan.

### DNA extraction and amplification
We used a bead beating DNA extraction kit. We amplified the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.


## Results
* Describe the site that I obtained samples from
* Differences in richness between types of sites
* Differences in beta-diversity between types of sites


## Discussion
1. Other way to make a **list** is by using the number *1* for every item in the list, so that if we want to add a new item in between, the *numeration* gets updated automatically
1. See the following ***examples***
1. More and more


## Conclusion
